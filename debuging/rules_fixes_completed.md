# Rules Fixes Completed - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Fixed Server Action Naming
**File**: `.cursor/rules/prj_coding_rules.mdc`
- **Line 94**: Changed from `action_name_sa.ts` to `actionNameSA.ts`
- Added note clarifying camelCase + SA suffix
- Added directory structure examples

### 2. ✅ Fixed Import Extension Clarification
**File**: `.cursor/rules/prj_general_rules.mdc`
- **Lines 59-61**: Added exception for test files
- Clarified that test files MUST use .js extensions for AVA
- Updated main rule to acknowledge exception

### 3. ✅ Removed Database Rules Typo
**File**: `.cursor/rules/prj_database_rules.mdc`
- **Lines 737-738**: Removed duplicate git history content
- File now ends properly with database content only

### 4. ✅ Added System Boundary Definition
**File**: `.cursor/rules/prj_coding_rules.mdc`
- **Lines 363-395**: Added comprehensive definition
- Clarified when to use Zod validation
- Added examples of system boundaries
- Included code examples for schema usage

### 5. ✅ Enhanced UUID Comment Scope
**File**: `.cursor/rules/prj_coding_rules.mdc`
- **Lines 323-330**: Added more specific examples
- Clarified what doesn't need UUIDs with inline examples
- Added: type definitions, export statements, const declarations

### 6. ✅ Added Component and Action Structure Examples
**File**: `.cursor/rules/prj_coding_rules.mdc`
- **Lines 194-236**: Added comprehensive examples
- Component directory structure with file patterns
- Server actions directory structure
- Naming conventions with do's and don'ts

### 7. ✅ Clarified Development History Workflow
**File**: `.cursor/rules/prj_uuid_tracking_rule.md`
- **Lines 26-31**: Added test creation step
- Clarified sequence: code → tests → verify → log
- Made test creation explicit in workflow

## ✅ User Decision Made

### Memory Conflict (ID: 5701938) - RESOLVED
**Issue**: Memory says tests go in `@test_workspace` but rules say `tests/` subfolder

**User Decision**: Remove the `@test_workspace` memory (Option A)

**Action Required**: 
- User needs to manually delete Memory ID 5701938 from their memory system
- Memory text to delete: "Test code should be created in @test_workspace directory for this project."
- After deletion, tests will use `tests/` subfolder per rules

**Why This Is Correct**:
1. ✅ Rules clearly specify `tests/` subfolders throughout
2. ✅ Testing rule shows comprehensive examples with `tests/` pattern
3. ✅ Consistent with all other module structures

## Impact of Changes

### What This Fixes:
- ✅ No more confusion about server action naming (camelCase vs snake_case)
- ✅ Clear guidance on when to use .js extensions
- ✅ Clear definition of "system boundaries" for Zod
- ✅ Better examples of when UUID comments aren't needed
- ✅ Directory structure examples for components and actions
- ✅ Workflow sequence includes test creation

### What Still Needs Action:
- ⚠️ User must decide on test location memory
- ⚠️ After decision, all rule conflicts will be resolved

## Verification Steps

After user approves memory decision:

1. Test rule comprehension:
   - Ask: "Create a server action for login" → Should create `loginUserSA.ts`
   - Ask: "Create tests for UserService" → Should create in `tests/` subfolder
   - Ask: "Should I validate this input?" → Should reference system boundary definition

2. Check import patterns:
   - Regular files: No .js extension
   - Test files: Use .js extension

3. Verify workflow:
   - Create code → Create tests → Log history
   - All steps should happen in order

## Files Modified

1. `.cursor/rules/prj_coding_rules.mdc` - Server actions, UUID scope, system boundaries, structure examples
2. `.cursor/rules/prj_general_rules.mdc` - Import extension exception
3. `.cursor/rules/prj_database_rules.mdc` - Removed duplicate content
4. `.cursor/rules/prj_uuid_tracking_rule.md` - Workflow clarification

## Next Steps

1. ✅ User decided on memory (Option A - Remove)
2. ⚠️ User must manually delete Memory ID 5701938
3. ✅ Verify all rules are consistent
4. ✅ Test with sample queries
5. ✅ Mark as complete

---

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All rule conflicts fixed
**Pending**: User needs to delete Memory ID 5701938 manually
**Date**: 2025-01-23
